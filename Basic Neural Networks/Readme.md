# Neural Networkds

Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks, are a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of multiple interconnected nodes or neurons, organized into layers that perform complex computations on input data.

The basic idea behind neural networks is to learn from data by adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons through a process called backpropagation. This process involves iteratively comparing the output of the network to the desired output, and then updating the weights and biases to minimize the error.

Neural networks can be used for a variety of tasks, such as classification, regression, and clustering, and they have been successfully applied to a wide range of domains, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

While neural networks have shown impressive performance in many applications, they can also be difficult to train and may suffer from overfitting, where the network performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new data. As a result, a lot of research is still being done to improve the performance and usability of neural networks.

Here we will try to make our own neural networks from scratch
